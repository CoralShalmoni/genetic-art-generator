<pre><code># Genetic Art Generator 🎨🧬 **Genetic Art Generator** is a creative tool that transforms DNA sequences into both pixel art images and musical compositions. It maps biological data into engaging audiovisual representations, combining science and art in a novel way. --- ## 🧬 What does this project do? This tool takes a DNA sequence and produces: - A unique pixel art image where nucleotides map to customizable colors - A MIDI music file where each base corresponds to a musical note Both outputs visualize genetic information in complementary formats, and are shown in pairs per DNA chunk. --- ## 📥 Input The project accepts DNA sequences in: - Plain `.txt` files containing raw sequences - `.fasta` format files - Direct input through the web interface (paste or upload) Only valid nucleotide characters (`A`, `T`, `C`, `G`) are processed. Sequences are cleaned, split into 256-base chunks, and padded with `N` if needed. --- ## 📤 Output For each DNA chunk (up to 10): - 🎨 A PNG image visualizing the sequence - 🎵 A MIDI file representing the sequence as music Results are saved in: - `assets/pixel_art/` - `assets/music/` And displayed side-by-side on the web interface. --- ## ⚙️ Technical Notes - Written in **Python 3.10+** - Built as a web app using **Flask** - Uses `Pillow` for pixel art - Uses `mido` + `python-rtmidi` for music - Color handling via `matplotlib` **Folder structure:** ``` genetic-art-generator/ ├── app.py ├── dna_to_pixel.py ├── dna_to_music.py ├── utils.py ├── requirements.txt ├── templates/ │ └── index.html ├── assets/ │ ├── pixel_art/ │ └── music/ ├── uploads/ └── README.md ``` --- ## 🚀 Installation & Running ### 1. Clone the project ```bash git clone https://github.com/CoralShalmoni/genetic-art-generator.git cd genetic-art-generator ``` ### 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment ```bash python -m venv venv # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate # On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate ``` ### 3. Install dependencies ```bash pip install -r requirements.txt ``` ### 4. Run the web app ```bash python app.py ``` Then open your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) --- ## 🧪 Example Example input (`example.fasta`): ``` >Example DNA ATGCGATACGTTAGCAGGTTTGA ``` Results: - `assets/pixel_art/` contains: `chunk_1_1-23.png` - `assets/music/` contains: `chunk_1_1-23.mid` - These are displayed in the app below a live preview of the sequence --- ## 🛠 Features - Accepts `.txt`, `.fasta`, or pasted input - Filters invalid characters - Pads short sequences with `N` - Displays DNA, image, and music side-by-side - Lets you customize: - Colors for each base - Music tempo (BPM) --- ## 🙏 Acknowledgments This project was developed as part of the Python programming course at Weizmann Institute of Science. 🎓 --- </code></pre>
